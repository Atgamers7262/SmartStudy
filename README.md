SmartStudy is a desktop study companion app built in Python with Flet that lets students manage courses, chapters, and subjects while tracking completion with progress bars. Users can upload and organize PDF books and notes, search YouTube lectures by subject/chapter, and keep all study data stored locally in their user data/AppData folders. The app includes login/registration, configurable class/board/stream settings, and a simple dark/light UI.
